# Cypress
Cypress automation project

Installation
- Need to have npm in your machine (nodejs)
- Npm install cypress
- Note: you can use a package.json to install cypress as dev dependency
   - Npm install --save-dev cypress
    It will create the node_modules which you donâ€™t have to git, just run npm install once you clone the project and it will create the dependencies in your machine

Running it
- Open with visual code
- You can use npx to run binaries, in case of cypress is very handy so just type (npm should be greater than 5.2)
  - npx cypress open (npm should be greater than 5.2)
- It will open a playground for you, with examples, also it creates a folder in your project called cypress
  - This message appears: We've added some folders and example tests to your project. Try running the tests in the examples folder or add your own test files to cypress/integration.
- It also creates a cypress.json in the root of the project
- You can click any of these examples in the playground to see what happens
